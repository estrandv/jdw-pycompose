# BUS args and Effects 
- Every single note should contain a bus argument:
    - Incorporate this in the defaults (bus 0), perhaps also a symbol
- Message support for effect creation is needed 
    - name, bus and args should be enough args
    - Should have some form of safety to avoid spamming 
- In PROSC:
    - New message handling for effect creation 
    - BUS arg for ALL synths including sampler
