        YES HELLO THIS IS FEATURE PLANNING AGAIN

        - Annoying things while jamming:
            * If some tracks are very long, calling queue will stop shorter tracks until a new loop begins
                - This has something to do with wipe_on_finish, but feels a bit hard to explain
                    - wipe is called: all tracks will end when finishing
                    - queue is called: all mentioned tracks remove the wipe flag
                - Could also be the new bilboard solution causing different track names  
                    -> I think this was the case
                - ANOTHER ISSUE THOU: If a track is notably shorter than the longest, it will stop too soon
                    -> Ideally, tracks should stop when the next long loop finishes 
            * AMP arg in SAMPLER appears breakable
                - Sometimes when there are multiple sampler synths active..? 
            * Relative args should have smarter resolution
                - E.g. setting "sus+4" on top level so that one can tinker with times that got messed up by keyboard 
                    -> Math rules is one way to handle it 
                    -> Custom mod also works, of course. One can keep the shuttle rules and just
                        eat into the string to process the args after the fact 

        - Jamming with friends
            - TODAY: 
                - If one person could play while the other controls the text, it would create a neat dynamic in itself
                    - Requirements: 
                        - Non-main keyboard input device (that other person can sit with elsewhere)
                        - Universal input reading, without window focus 
                        -> Generally: Wiring up the MIDI keyboard would have a lot of good results 
                        -> Should not replace current keyboard, but be an alternative to it 
                        -> "Please save that one" is an easy way to transfer data when jamming, even if there is 
                            no way to send directly 
            - Secondary input sources 
                - For a device to be independent, it must be able to send queues to the jam without a clipboard middleman 
                    - OPTION A: Interface, with hidden sequences
                        - Requires: Tracks, Send, Wipe, 
                    - OPTION B: Auto-write to common file 
                        - Similar requirements, honestly, but could hack it as a pure print-to in beginning of course 
                        - 

        - Delay Unification
            ?? Because we should have a general idea, across applications, of when an actual sound is played 
            - Keyboard has a hard time differentiating between message arrival and play time due to SC delay
            - Also: JDW_SC still has that awkward middleman problem where most added features are just ways 
                around doing things "natively". 
            - NOTE_ON_TIMED
                - The gate_off message can be sent as part of the sequence if it is allowed to be delayed 
                - The main issue is that the sequencer does not know the contents of its messages
                    -> And so, each loop can only have the same constant time
                    -> ... while supercollider uses absolute time for delayed execution
                - A SEND_DELAYED message can be implemented in supercollider
                    + Would remove need for delay arg in other messages
                    + Would remove need for note_on_timed altogether
                    + Can be a bundle with many messages
                    + Can be interpreted by other applications
                    + Can probably be implemented as native supercollider code, somehow 
                        -> See: read_scd  
                        -> It's possible that a native "beat delay" or "sec delay" already exists, as opposed to 
                            calculating time from beats. 
                    - Does not solve issue with wanting absolute time of execution
                - Getting around the sequencer limitation: 
                    - Messages can pre-calculate their intervals...
                        ... but then the sequencer bpm changes ...  
                    - Sequencer can append info to messages sent as "send_time" 
                        - Sadly, this would mean another wrapping of the message and more confusion in the router
                        - Not necessarily a performance hog or inconvenience, but the gain would have to be very clear 
                            for this to be worth it  

        - CPU Usage
            - input_lab sits at a constant 33% and makes the fans run 
            - input_lab also struggles to produce the stringify it beomes very long
                -> Ideally this hsould be threaded - there's no need to stringify while trying to play 
                -> Another thread, a stringify flag in state, off ye go 
                    -> Sometihng something don't lock keys while performing stringify 
            - Sequencer eats a decent amount of CPU even when stopped
                -> Ideally it should have some kind of dead-poll that is a lot slower than the current 4ms 
            

        - Vector Queues
            ?? To facilitate drum breaks and smoother jamming of longer songs
            - STEPS:
                1. Implement support in sequecer, but with the queue always being a singleton list
                2. Change sequencer queue message to contain a list, then change pycompose and tests to use a singleton queue list


                4. Add support in pycompose for splitting queues into separate sections 
                5. Add support in pycompose for the now different queue and nrt messages 
        
        - Entry point messages
            ?? Because we might want manually defined points where new queues can start 
            ?? Because it's a quicker way to implement some of the value of vector queues 
            - So: 
                - Sequencer receives a message that says "entry toggle" (basically sends to itself)
                - A switch is flipped so that a single start is possible, after which the switch goes off again 

        - Knobstation
            ?? To have some fun with the Minilab 
            - STEPS:
                1. Add a knobreader application, similar to the keyboard, that detects input via the Minilab
                2. Add OSC configuration for binding specific knobs to specific buses 

        - A return to Timeline Scores 
            ?? To better help construct longer compositions
            - STEPS:
                1. Brainstorm how and if the Tracker can be used to build longer sequences
                    - Remember the old idea of first defining a sequence and then playing
                    - So tracks can be defined as they are today, but then extended 
                    - You can easily create a separate set of collections inside the Tracker for the Scoring purpose, 
                        so that existing functionality is not affected
                    - tracks.score_into_bundles() ... 
                    - repeat_until(len) is once again essential, so that you can say "play these tracks until x time"
                        - This also allows padding with silence to keep tracks an equal length


                    - .break(name, parse, peers) can be a way of saying "play this once, creating a track for it at this time, with peers playing along"
