    ISSUES & FEATURES

    - BUG: First parts of alternations don't inherit their args properly 
        - Shuttle notation issue, example: (a (b / c)):amp4 <-- b does not get amp4
        - Update: Added a test in which at least suffix reading seems ok, see "g2 = section_parsing" 
            (a (1 / 0) b)c would give "c" to 1's history, at least 

    - Synths
        - generally just expanding the library with better stuff

    - Full billboarding support
        - Bonus: "replace this track with this if running other group" 
            -> As in "gain the external id" so that you can switch things mid play for shorter tracks

    - Keyboard 
        - Separate key backend parts of keys and use it to revive input_lab
        - Implement all different config messages  
        - TODO: Dot-in-string-on-loop-start

    - Delay Unification
        - Since Supercollider has an internal delay, it is impossible for jackdaw apps to know <exactly> when
            a note is played for the human ear. 
        - The only way to get anywhere near this is to emit some form of event in jdw_sc to the router when 
            a note <actually> plays, either going via supercollider callback or as a delay-send to router

    - CPU Usage
        - input_lab sits at a constant 33% and makes the fans run 
        - Sequencer eats a decent amount of CPU even when stopped
            -> Ideally it should have some kind of dead-poll that is a lot slower than the current 4ms             

    - Meta-sequencer as a new app
        - Longer notes in e.g. dev-diary, but this solves many composition issues wihtout 
            making the regular sequencer more complex 
        - Syntax? 
            >>> drum bass riff ยง4
            >>> drum bass chords ยง2
            ... doesn't have to be harder 

    - A return to Timeline Scores 
        ?? To better help construct longer compositions
        - STEPS:
            1. Brainstorm how and if the Tracker can be used to build longer sequences
                - Remember the old idea of first defining a sequence and then playing
                - So tracks can be defined as they are today, but then extended 
                - You can easily create a separate set of collections inside the Tracker for the Scoring purpose, 
                    so that existing functionality is not affected
                - tracks.score_into_bundles() ... 
                - repeat_until(len) is once again essential, so that you can say "play these tracks until x time"
                    - This also allows padding with silence to keep tracks an equal length


                - .break(name, parse, peers) can be a way of saying "play this once, creating a track for it at this time, with peers playing along"
        - Would the meta-sequencer be able to perhaps record or simplify this? To avoid reinventing the wheel? 
            - You have all the notes available at the start, but you might not want to read them too carefully?
            - You can technically reverse things the same way that the keyboard does, plus individual args. 
                -> You'd get pretty messed up code, but it would work
                -> Still, you can do this just fine in jdw-pycompose without involving another application 

        

    - Documentation and other Boring Stuff
        - shuttle notation (once we're happy with the syntax)
        - sequencer lib (no blocker)
        - jdw sc error proofing
        - sequencer and sc OSC-driven-configuration
